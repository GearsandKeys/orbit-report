# OrbitReport - LaunchCode Assignment 6

I used Angular and typescript to:
Create list components and pass in objects.
Display a table of the objects passed in.
Fetch data to fill the table.
Use Angular attributes to highlight objects that met certain conditions.
Build in sorting methods in the table.
Built a search method.
